# Automate Institutional DeFi with the New Ondo Finance Node for n8n

We're excited to announce the release of our latest community node: n8n-nodes-ondo-finance! As institutional adoption of decentralized finance continues to accelerate, Velocity BPA is making it easier than ever to integrate Ondo Finance's tokenized real-world assets into your automation workflows.

## Why This Matters

Ondo Finance has emerged as a leader in bringing institutional-grade financial products to the blockchain. Their platform offers tokenized US Treasuries (OUSG), yield-bearing stablecoins (USDY), tokenized stocks and ETFs through Ondo Global Markets, and the Flux Finance lending protocol. However, integrating these sophisticated DeFi products into existing business processes has traditionally required extensive blockchain development expertise.

That changes today.

## What You Can Automate

The n8n-nodes-ondo-finance node brings the power of tokenized real-world assets directly into your n8n workflows. Whether you're building treasury management systems, creating automated compliance reports, monitoring yield positions, or integrating DeFi lending into your financial operations, this node makes it possible without writing a single line of smart contract code.

Key features include:
- **USDY Operations**: Interact with Ondo's yield-bearing stablecoin to automate treasury yield strategies
- **OUSG Integration**: Monitor and manage tokenized US Treasury positions
- **Global Markets Access**: Track tokenized stocks and ETFs for international portfolio automation
- **Flux Finance Support**: Automate lending and borrowing operations across the Flux protocol
- **Real-time Data**: Pull current rates, balances, and market data directly into your workflows

## Getting Started

Installing the Ondo Finance node is straightforward. In your n8n instance, simply run:


npm install n8n-nodes-ondo-finance


After installation, restart n8n and you'll find the Ondo Finance node available in your node palette. The node comes with intuitive configuration options and comprehensive documentation to get you up and running quickly.

## Open Source and Community-Driven

As with all our community nodes, n8n-nodes-ondo-finance is fully open source. You can view the code, contribute improvements, or report issues on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/Velocity-BPA/n8n-nodes-ondo-finance
